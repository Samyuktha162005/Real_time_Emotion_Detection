🎨📷Real-Time Emotion Detection from Images using Deep Learning

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from facial expressions in real time using a webcam or static images. It uses the FER-2013 dataset for training and OpenCV for real-time face detection.


🔍Overview
